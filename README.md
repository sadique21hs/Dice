### How to Play:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.
2. Click on the "Roll Dice" button to roll both dice simultaneously.
3. The game will compare the values of the two dice:
    - If the value of Dice 1 is greater than Dice 2, Player 1 wins.
    - If the value of Dice 2 is greater than Dice 1, Player 2 wins.
    - If both dice have the same value, it's a draw.
4. The result will be displayed on the screen.
